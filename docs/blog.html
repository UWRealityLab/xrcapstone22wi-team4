						<h4>What We've Accomplished</h4>
					</header>
					<p>This week we focused on finalizing our project idea, developing the pitch and the PRD. We found some assets that we think will be perfect for our grocery stores and can be reused for the different markets. We’ve developed a plan for how and when we want to complete the different milestones of our project implementation. We met with course staff to discuss our idea and incorporated that feedback into our PRD.</p>
					<p>All members: Project pitch slide deck, PRD writing, writing the Week 3 snippet, searching for viable 3d models on the Unity Asset store</p>

						<h4>Code Update</h4>

					<p>No development has begun yet, but we found a lot of great assets on the Unity Asset store that we’ll likely use for development.</p>

						<h4>Blockers</h4>

					<p>We currently don’t have any blocking issues, although I’m sure that’s going to change next week. We really appreciate everyone’s advice on our PRD and target product!</p>

						<h2>Weeks 1 + 2</h2>
						<p>Getting situated (in VR), a range of ideas, and a whole lot of Beatsaber...</p>

						<h4>What We've Accomplished</h4>
					</header>
					<p>The first couple weeks of the quarter and the VR capstone class involved a lot of settling into the class and getting ramped up on how to use the VR headsets. We obtained the Oculus Quest 2 devices from the course staff, set them up, and immediately started playing Beatsaber to get familiarized with the VR environment. As for more productive tasks, we also completed the Intro to Unity tutorials and the VR demo project assigned in class.</p>
					<p>Deciding on a project idea was the most difficult part of the class so far, since we had ideas ranging from a Pacman-x-Ghostbusters-inspired maze game, to a cat simulator (as in, you’re the cat in VR), to an education / awareness school shooting simulation. We were pretty passionate about the school shooting app since we thought it served an important purpose for raising awareness and could be very impactful. However, given the time constraints we face in this capstone (about 7-8 weeks of actual development time), we thought we wouldn’t have time to do justice to this idea and may end up with an extremely underwhelming product. We were also interested in the Pacman-inspired game since we thought the idea of racing through a maze in VR while ghosts chased you could be an interesting experience.</p>
					<p>After workshopping the idea with the course staff however, we realized that we didn’t have a coherent core game mechanic for the game, so it would be difficult to make meaningful stretch goals for it.</p>
					<p>We finally decided on a global grocery experience after going through our brainstormed ideas list with the course staff. As a group, we were interested in the idea of exploring the purchasing power of $50 USD in different grocery markets around the world. In particular, we thought it would be interesting to do a blind grocery run, where you could try and spend as close to $50 as possible. Not only would it be cool to explore how markets look around the world, but you would be able to see how the prices of everyday items change by location.</p>

						<h4>Code Update</h4>
					</header>
					<p>We haven’t started actual development of the global grocery project yet, but anticipate that we will next week after finalizing our idea more!</p>
					
					<header>
						<h4>Blockers</h4>
					</header>
					<p>We don’t have any major blocking issues development-wise, but we want to get our Global Grocery app idea reviewed by the course staff before starting to code since we decided on this idea a bit late in Week 2.</p>
