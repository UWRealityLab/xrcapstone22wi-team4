					<h2>Week 4</h2>
					<p>Research and Shopping Cart Physics</p>
				</header>

				<!-- <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a> -->

					<h4>What We've Accomplished</h4>
				</header>
				<p>This week we focused on researching different grocery store interior designs for American, Chinese, and Mexican grocery stores, purchasing basic grocery store assets (we bought one asset pack along with a separate shopping cart), and implementing a basic shopping cart with the physics associated with grabbing items and pushing the cart.</p>
				<p>Here’s a quick demo of our current cart:</p>
				<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://youtu.be/8XCe0XTf_Is"></iframe>
				<p>As you can see, there’s clearly some bugs that we need to fix. When the cart moves, items in the cart have a tendency to bounce around. We plan on fixing this sometime next week. </p>

				<header>
					<h4>Individual Contributions</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Annalice: Worked on building a basic demo scene and implementing expected shopping cart movement and behavior.</p>
				<p>Donna: Worked on building a basic demo scene and implementing expected shopping cart movement and behavior, changed the VR controllers to use hands instead of rays.</p>
				<p>Worked on creating the new version of the website with multiple pages and researching different grocery store designs for the three grocery stores.</p>
				
				<header>
					<h4>Code Updates</h4>
				</header>
				<ul>
					<li> Created new Unity project </li>
					<li>Set up XR library required for player movement and grabbing objects</li>
					<li>Imported grocery supermarket assets into new Unity project</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Tested supermarket demo scene that came with the assets, found that it was too laggy in VR</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Created new demo scene to test out assets</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Added a few shelves, walls, flooring, grabbable store items, and a shopping cart</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Customized the shopping cart asset to have colliders that allow for putting objects in the cart naturally</li>
					<li>Implemented shopping cart physics (still need to be refined more)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Shopping cart stays on the ground</li>
						<li>Shopping cart doesn’t jitter when items are placed into it</li>
						<li>Shopping cart is only grabbable from the handlebar area and stays in front of the player</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Made all grocery store items grabbable</li>
					<li>Changed VR controllers to use hands instead of default rays so that player can only pick up and move objects that they can grab</li>
				</ul>

				<header>
					<h4>Plans for Next Week</h4>
				</header>
				<p>By the end of next week, we plan to both finalize the layout of our American grocery store and build it out. The grocery store will be completely populated with items that are grabbable and will have associated prices. We also plan on smoothing out the cart’s motion, and turning. We will also be finalizing what the Mexican and Chinese grocery stores will look like.</p>

				<header>
					<h4>Blockers</h4>
				</header>
				<p>We are currently uncertain about how to code certain behaviors into the cart. For example, we are having trouble with turning the cart and were thinking about adding some acceleration/deceleration to the cart on push. Our current plan is to extend/copy paste the XRGrabInteractable script and modify the ‘PerformKinematicUpdate’.</p>
				<p>Question: What else would the staff recommend that we look at to smooth out the cart movement?</p>

						<h2>Week 3</h2>
						<p>Project Pitch & PRD</p>
					</header>

					<!-- <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a> -->
					
					<header>
						<h4>What We've Accomplished</h4>
					</header>
					<p>This week we focused on finalizing our project idea, developing the pitch and the PRD. We found some assets that we think will be perfect for our grocery stores and can be reused for the different markets. We’ve developed a plan for how and when we want to complete the different milestones of our project implementation. We met with course staff to discuss our idea and incorporated that feedback into our PRD.</p>
					<p>All members: Project pitch slide deck, PRD writing, writing the Week 3 snippet, searching for viable 3d models on the Unity Asset store</p>

					<header>
						<h4>Code Update</h4>
					</header>
					<p>No development has begun yet, but we found a lot of great assets on the Unity Asset store that we’ll likely use for development.</p>
					
					<header>
						<h4>Blockers</h4>
					</header>
					<p>We currently don’t have any blocking issues, although I’m sure that’s going to change next week. We really appreciate everyone’s advice on our PRD and target product!</p>

						<h2>Weeks 1 + 2</h2>
						<p>Getting situated (in VR), a range of ideas, and a whole lot of Beatsaber...</p>
					</header>

					<!-- <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a> -->

						<h4>What We've Accomplished</h4>
					</header>
					<p>The first couple weeks of the quarter and the VR capstone class involved a lot of settling into the class and getting ramped up on how to use the VR headsets. We obtained the Oculus Quest 2 devices from the course staff, set them up, and immediately started playing Beatsaber to get familiarized with the VR environment. As for more productive tasks, we also completed the Intro to Unity tutorials and the VR demo project assigned in class.</p>
					<p>Deciding on a project idea was the most difficult part of the class so far, since we had ideas ranging from a Pacman-x-Ghostbusters-inspired maze game, to a cat simulator (as in, you’re the cat in VR), to an education / awareness school shooting simulation. We were pretty passionate about the school shooting app since we thought it served an important purpose for raising awareness and could be very impactful. However, given the time constraints we face in this capstone (about 7-8 weeks of actual development time), we thought we wouldn’t have time to do justice to this idea and may end up with an extremely underwhelming product. We were also interested in the Pacman-inspired game since we thought the idea of racing through a maze in VR while ghosts chased you could be an interesting experience.</p>
					<p>After workshopping the idea with the course staff however, we realized that we didn’t have a coherent core game mechanic for the game, so it would be difficult to make meaningful stretch goals for it.</p>
					<p>We finally decided on a global grocery experience after going through our brainstormed ideas list with the course staff. As a group, we were interested in the idea of exploring the purchasing power of $50 USD in different grocery markets around the world. In particular, we thought it would be interesting to do a blind grocery run, where you could try and spend as close to $50 as possible. Not only would it be cool to explore how markets look around the world, but you would be able to see how the prices of everyday items change by location.</p>

					<header>
						<h4>Code Update</h4>
					</header>
					<p>We haven’t started actual development of the global grocery project yet, but anticipate that we will next week after finalizing our idea more!</p>
					
					<header>
						<h4>Blockers</h4>
					</header>
					<p>We don’t have any major blocking issues development-wise, but we want to get our Global Grocery app idea reviewed by the course staff before starting to code since we decided on this idea a bit late in Week 2.</p>
