## Project Overview

Our app will be an educational experience where the user explores grocery stores from 4+ different countries and tries to buy as much food as possible using a set amount of money. This experience helps people gain perspective on how expensive (ior inexpensive) it is to live in different countries in terms of buying food. By immersing the user in different grocery stores and markets around the world, we hope that they can learn about the purchasing power in countries around the world.

Hello! I’m Khushi and I’m a senior majoring in Computer Science at UW. I’ve never really worked and used much of VR before, but have been looking forward to this class since freshman year. Looking forward to learning more and creating things in VR!

Hello! I’m also a senior studying computer science. My first and only experience with VR was playing beatsaber at a convention a couple of years ago. I’m super excited to jump into the development process and learn more about VR!

Hi! I’m a senior studying computer science with interdisciplinary honors at UW. I was lucky to have a bit of VR dev experience during a high school internship, and I’m really excited to get back into it through the VR Capstone!

## Weeks 1 + 2 (also to be reformatted later)
Getting situated (in VR), a range of ideas, and a whole lot of Beatsaber…
What we’ve worked on

The first couple weeks of the quarter and the VR capstone class involved a lot of settling into the class and getting ramped up on how to use the VR headsets. We obtained the Oculus Quest 2 devices from the course staff, set them up, and immediately started playing Beatsaber to get familiarized with the VR environment. As for more productive tasks, we also completed the Intro to Unity tutorials and the VR demo project assigned in class.

Deciding on a project idea was the most difficult part of the class so far, since we had ideas ranging from a Pacman-x-Ghostbusters-inspired maze game, to a cat simulator (as in, you’re the cat in VR), to an education / awareness school shooting simulation. We were pretty passionate about the school shooting app since we thought it served an important purpose for raising awareness and could be very impactful. However, given the time constraints we face in this capstone (about 7-8 weeks of actual development time), we thought we wouldn’t have time to do justice to this idea and may end up with an extremely underwhelming product. We were also interested in the Pacman-inspired game since we thought the idea of racing through a maze in VR while ghosts chased you could be an interesting experience.

After workshopping the idea with the course staff however, we realized that we didn’t have a coherent core game mechanic for the game, so it would be difficult to make meaningful stretch goals for it.

We finally decided on a global grocery experience after going through our brainstormed ideas list with the course staff. As a group, we were interested in the idea of exploring the purchasing power of $50 USD in different grocery markets around the world. In particular, we thought it would be interesting to do a blind grocery run, where you could try and spend as close to $50 as possible. Not only would it be cool to explore how markets look around the world, but you would be able to see how the prices of everyday items change by location.

Team member tasks:
Annalice: brainstorming, project MVP doc, Unity VR demo project, setting up Github website

Donna: brainstorming, project MVP doc, Unity VR demo project, project website setup

Khushi: brainstorming, project MVP doc, Unity VR demo project

Code update:
We haven’t started actual development of the global grocery project yet, but anticipate that we will next week after finalizing our idea more!

Blocking issues:
We don’t have any major blocking issues development-wise, but we want to get our Global Grocery app idea reviewed by the course staff before starting to code since we decided on this idea a bit late in Week 2.
