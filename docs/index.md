## Project Overview

Our app will be an educational experience where the user explores grocery stores from 4+ different countries and tries to buy as much food as possible using a set amount of money. This experience helps people gain perspective on how expensive (ior inexpensive) it is to live in different countries in terms of buying food. By immersing the user in different grocery stores and markets around the world, we hope that they can learn about the purchasing power in countries around the world.
